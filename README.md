# Capstone 2 Proposal 

Proposal for my second capstone project 

## Tech Stack 

React and Node.

## Project Focus

Front-end UI.

## Type 

Website. 

## Goal 

Filter, search or favorite animals a user is interested in adopting. 

## User Type 

All demographics. Anyone looking to adopt a pet. Ages 25-55

## Data type 

Use the Petfinder API to get access to an array of pets available for adoption. Data would also include individual info about the pet (name, breed, color, gender, age) & location of where the adoption agency is. 

## Approach 
In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
            Animal ID
        	breed
        	sex
        	size
        	environment
        	location

            Agency ID 
            address
            phone 
            Animal ID

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
    Favoriting pets that a user can go back and veiw later. (Had an issue doing this with my last capstone project)
c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
    Username and password info 
d. What functionality will your app include?
    Search, filter, pet and adoption agency info. 
e. What will the user flow look like?
    Register or log in, see list of pets available, search by pet type, age, gender & adoption agency.  
f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your
stretch goals?
    Being able to use GPS to find an adoption agency near a user.
